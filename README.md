# PTF Tutorials

This repository contains a set of tutorials for the ORKG-PTF.

The files are not in any particular order. The tutorials are done directly in the interactive sessions without prior preparations so expect some mistakes and typos.

### 8 Queens Problem using Genetic Algorithm
The 8 queens problem is a classic problem in which we have to place 8 queens on a chess board such that no queen is attacking any other queen. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column or diagonal.

The genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.

The script: [queens.py](queens.py) contains the implementation of the genetic algorithm for the 8 queens problem. The script is well commented and should be easy to follow.

Which can be run with a simple `python queens.py`.
